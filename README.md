## 🌐 Smart Edge Lab  
The Smart Edge Lab is a research group at Fachhochschule Dortmund focused on groundbreaking edge-computing infrastructures and services. Our interdisciplinary teams partner closely with industry to develop application-oriented research. 

### 🔍 EMULATE  Project in the Smart Edge Lab  

Our project **EMULATE** delivers tools to **measure**, **analyze**, and **optimize** performance in the European cloud-edge continuum. Whether you’re testing autonomous driving, augmented reality, smart-grid control, or UAV orchestration, EMULATE provides:

- **Emulation Platform**  
  Create a virtual twin of any physical environment—networks, infrastructures, apps, and events—to experiment with deployment scenarios for real-time applications.

- **A Service Quality Manager (SeQaM)**  
  Gather in-depth QoS metrics from both physical and emulated setups, helping you assess and refine end-to-end service quality management in edge computing.





The [EMULATE](https://www.fh-dortmund.de/microsite/smartedgelab/projekte/emulate.php?loc=en) project is part of the Important Project of Common European Interest – Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS) under the name of [8ra](https://www.8ra.com/) ("ORA" = continuum) Initiative. With more than 120 partners from 12 EU Member States, the 8ra Initiative aims to build Europe’s Next Generation Cloud Infrastructure and Services towards digital sovereignty, establishing a unified “cloud-edge continuum” that operates independently of any single provider.
